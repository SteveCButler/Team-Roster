# Bandmates (aka Team Roster project)
Bandmates is a place for musicians to connect.  The idea is like the old school bulletin boards in music stores where people would post messages like "guitarist looking for bass player and drummer for rock trio".  Bandmates allows users to post information on what instrument, genre, and other information like their experience level or commitment level (looking to go pro, looking to jam, ...).

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a musician
- Making music with others is way more fun that sitting alone 
- The problem this app solves is that it is often hard to find other musicians to get together and make music with.  Finding people that play the genre(s) of music you like, live close, have the same mindset ("I just want to jam", "I want to be a rockstar", "I want to write original music") can be hard, that's where Bandmates comes in.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When logging in a user lands on the home screen that tells a bit about what Bandmates is and how to use it
- From there a user can view the list of member musicians on the Musicians page and view info about each musician
